# CropYield_Forecast_CASA00025

CropInvest is a collaborative team research at UCL CASA to develop a crop yield forecasting application for North Dakota, USA. This exciting project is based on the combined efforts of six team members: ofitrahramadhan, burhanucl2023, ZimengSong1996, Vannie777, jianghan0v0 and me (LiangWeiXian11).

The application was built using the Random Forest approach for crop yield modelling and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for user interaction and visualisation. We trained three different models for the three main crop types (corn, wheat, and soybeans) and provided county- and pixel-level crop yield information. CropInvest is designed to meet the needs of users for crop yield monitoring, specifically banks, government agencies, farmers and non-profit organisations, by providing historical yield data from 2018 to 2023 and projected yields for 2024.


The above is only a brief description of the application, more structured and detailed content is available: https://liangweixian11.github.io/CropYield_Forecast_Proj
