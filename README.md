# CropYield_Forecast_CASA00025

CropInvest is a collaborative team research at UCL CASA to develop a crop yield forecasting application for North Dakota, USA. This exciting project is based on the combined efforts of team members: ofitrahramadhan, burhanucl2023, ZimengSong1996, Vannie777, jianghan0v0 and me (LiangWeiXian11).

The application was built using the Random Forest approach for crop yield modelling and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for user interaction and visualisation.
