# CropYield_Forecast_CASA00025
## Overall
CropInvest is a collaborative team research at UCL CASA to develop a crop yield forecasting application for North Dakota, USA. This exciting project is based on the combined efforts of six team members: ofitrahramadhan, burhanucl2023, ZimengSong1996, Vannie777, jianghan0v0 and me (LiangWeiXian11).

The application was built using the Random Forest approach for crop yield modelling and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for user interaction and visualisation. We trained three different models for the three main crop types (corn, wheat, and soybeans) and provided county- and pixel-level crop yield information. CropInvest is designed to meet the needs of users for crop yield monitoring, specifically banks, government agencies, farmers and non-profit organisations, by providing historical yield data from 2018 to 2023 and projected yields for 2024.

## Demand Analysis
### Background of the project :
•	Project Name : Crop Yield Estimation App

•	Target users : Farmers, insurance companies, governments

•	Project goal : To provide a user-friendly yield visualization interface and yield estimation function for target crop production areas

### Requirements Collection :
•	User interviews : None

•	Literature and information review:
1. Materials: Internet-related interviews, relevant academic articles
2. Topic: User's attention to crop yield and quick query
3. Result:
    - Farmers want to know in advance the expected yield of all their farmland
    - Insurance companies hope to know the expected future returns of the target farmland in advance so as to provide loans
    - The government wants online visualization capabilities to monitor the total yield of target crops in its jurisdiction on a large scale

-	Competitive product analysis :
    -	Analysis object : Crop yield prediction in Senegal, Africa 
    -	Analysis dimensions : function list, user experience
    -	Analysis results :
        -	This is an application using open-source satellite images to identify the crops and estimate the yields for any given area
        -	Competitors have the ability for users to draw areas of interest
        -	Long response time for production forecast
        -	URL: https://www.omdena.com/blog/yield-prediction

### Requirements organization and prioritization
-	Function classification : basic functions, advanced functions
-	Prioritization (using MoSCoW):
    -	Must-have: Crop visualization , yield query , value estimation
    -	Should-have : User-defined crop prices , yield statistics at the administrative district scale
    -	Could-have : Determine the statistical area according to the crop yield statistical chart of the administrative area and the shapefile uploaded by the user,
    -	Won't-have : Functions with low demand , high cost , or that do not conform to the objective situation (such as yield forecasts for the next five years, crop yield trend charts by year) are not considered for the time being.

### Requirements verification and implementation :
-	Requirements verification :
    -	Discuss the technical feasibility and implementation difficulty of the requirements with team members
    -	Verify the availability of key requirements through communication with instructors and classmates
-	Inter-departmental communication :
    -	Regularly communicate requirements with instructors and data teams to ensure consistent understanding
    -	Organize weekly team meetings to confirm the priority and implementation plan of functions
