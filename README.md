# CropYield_Forecast_CASA00025

CropInvest is a collaborative team research at UCL CASA to develop a crop yield forecasting application for North Dakota, USA. This exciting project is based on the combined efforts of six team members: ofitrahramadhan, burhanucl2023, ZimengSong1996, Vannie777, jianghan0v0 and me (LiangWeiXian11).

The application was built using the Random Forest approach for crop yield modelling and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for user interaction and visualisation. We trained three different models for the three main crop types (corn, wheat, and soybeans) and provided county- and pixel-level crop yield information. CropInvest is designed to meet the needs of users for crop yield monitoring, specifically banks, government agencies, farmers and non-profit organisations, by providing historical yield data from 2018 to 2023 and projected yields for 2024.

## Demand Analysis
### Background of the project :
•	Project Name : Crop Yield Estimation App

•	Target users : Farmers, insurance companies, governments

•	Project goal : To provide a user-friendly yield visualization interface and yield estimation function for target crop production areas

### Requirements Collection :
•	User interviews : None

•	Literature and information review:
1. Materials: Internet-related interviews, relevant academic articles
2. Topic: User's attention to crop yield and quick query
3. Result:
    - Farmers want to know in advance the expected yield of all their farmland
    - Insurance companies hope to know the expected future returns of the target farmland in advance so as to provide loans
    - The government wants online visualization capabilities to monitor the total yield of target crops in its jurisdiction on a large scale

•	Competitive product analysis :
o	Analysis object : Crop yield prediction in Senegal, Africa 
o	Analysis dimensions : function list, user experience
o	Analysis results :
	This is an application using open-source satellite images to identify the crops and estimate the yields for any given area
	Competitors have the ability for users to draw areas of interest
